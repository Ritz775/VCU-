            As a student in the I2CRP track program, M4 Austin Oberlin is
            committed and dedicated to working with medically underserved
            populations. This desire to make a difference is what led him to the
            I2CRP program and to VCU, and it inspired him to apply for the
            prestigious Fogarty Global Health Fellowship. When he was selected
            to one of seven Fogarty fellows traveling abroad, he spent a year in
            South Africa to conduct his research, with a focus on women's
            preferences for cervical cancer screening.

            For two years before coming to medical school, I was in Mabaruma,
            Guyana. I was there as a teacher with the non-profit WorldTeach, but
            I quickly began spending every free minute after school in the
            hospital. The Mabaruma Regional Hospital is more than just a place
            where people come with local emergencies — it is the only hospital
            within hundreds of miles and functions as the only place where
            communities along the Barima and Waini rivers can go for any type of
            health care. I have lived most of my life in rural areas — I grew up
            in rural Virginia — but I had never seen extreme poverty like this.
            As I shadowed one of the hospital's two doctors in his daily
            rotations, it was the first time I'd been exposed to lack of medical
            resources that people in the rural developing world face.

              In an effort, to protect the students, VCU University says, "All students 
            required to take and give vaccine documents." VCU has point. Covid cases rising 
            everyday keeping kids alive to succeed is a big resssponsiblity. With some major casulties students without the vaccine 
            are dying. However, students are being reponsible and are taking vaccines. Let's hope that COVID-19 will keep it's 
            distance from VCU!

                  Tara Donovan (born 1969 in Flushing, Queens, in New York City) 
                is an American sculptor who lives and works in Brooklyn, New York. 
                Her large-scale installations, sculptures, drawings, and prints utilize 
                everyday objects to explore the transformative effects of accumulation and 
                aggregation. Known for her commitment to process, 
                she has earned acclaim for her ability to exploit the inherent 
                physical characteristics of an object in order to transform it into 
                works that generate unique perceptual phenomena and atmospheric effects. 
                Her work has been conceptually linked to an art historical lineage that 
                includes Postminimalism and Process artists such as Eva Hesse, 
                Jackie Winsor, Richard Serra, and Robert Morris, along with Light and 
                Space artists such as Mary Corse, Helen Pashgian, Robert Irwin, 
                and James Turrell.
